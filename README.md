*Read this in other languages: [English](README.md), [简体中文](README-zh.md).*

Scripts to install your own <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost" target="_blank">Ghost blog</a>, with <a href="http://nginx.org/en/" target="_blank">Nginx</a> (as a reverse proxy) and <a href="https://www.modsecurity.org/" target="_blank">ModSecurity</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nbs-system/naxsi" target="_blank">Naxsi</a> web application firewall for better performance and security.

Ghost is a simple, modern <a href="https://ghost.org/vs/wordpress/" target="_blank">WordPress alternative</a> which puts the excitement back into blogging. It's beautifully designed, easy to use, completely open source, and free for everyone.

**NEW:** You can now install **up to 10** blogs on the same server. Just run the script again with a new full domain name.

## How To Use

sudo bash ghost-nginx-modsecurity.sh BLOG_FULL_DOMAIN_NAME
